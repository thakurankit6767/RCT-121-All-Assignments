The iPhone was subsequently released in Europe in 2007 and Asia in 2008.Apple designed its first mobile smartphone to run the Mac OS X operating system, made popular on the company’s personal computers. The device’s most revolutionary element was its touch-sensitive multisensor interface. The touchscreen allowed users to manipulate all programs and telephone functions with their fingertips rather than a stylus or physical keys.

The iPhone also featured Internet browsing, music and video playback, a digital camera, visual voicemail, and a tabbed contact list.",
